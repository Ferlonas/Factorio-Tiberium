Priority 1: UPS with growth- Done
2:Fix the rest of the events
-Damage, and the exclusions for it
-Liquid tib in inventory on death spawns ore, leaves "acid" puddle
-Change growth code to use node richness instead of distance from spawn.
-Modded power poles appear to take damage from growth. Mod Advanced Electric.
3: Fill in missing items
-Basic Weaponry
-blue tib
4: Future, New content
-More weaponry (If applicable)
-More tech nuance_ Added one tech, for 4 total
-Green tib with enough turns into blue tib


Description of various refining paths:

Path 1: Ore Centrifuging

Insert ore and water into Centrifuge, get all products. (Iron, Copper, Stone, Uranium, Coal, Crude Oil)

Path 2: Tiberium Sludge Centrifuging- Higher Yield, more effort for refining

Process ore into sludge and waste with water in oil refinery. Waste can be reporcessed with liquid tib to be absorbed.

Feed sludge into centrifuge, get all products. (Iron, Copper, Stone, Uranium, Coal, Crude Oil)

Path 3: Liquid Tib Centrifuging- Higher Yield, more effort for refining

Process ore and water in oil refinery to make liquid tib, later tech than sludge. No waste.

Feed liquid tib into centrifuge, get all products. (Iron, Copper, Stone, Uranium, Coal, Crude Oil)

Path 4: Liquid Tib direct conversion (Through Bricks or direct from liquid)

Process ore and water in oil refinery to make liquid tib, later tech than sludge. No waste.

(OPTIONAL) Process liquid into bricks, move bricks/pipe liquid to location.

Turn into single product, lower yield than centrifuging overall.
