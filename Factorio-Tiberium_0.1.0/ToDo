Priority 1: UPS with growth
-See if we can get 30
2:Fix the rest of the events
-Damage, and the exclusions for it
-Liquid tib in inventory on death spawns ore, leaves "acid" puddle
3: Fill in missing items
-Basic Weaponry
-Gate
-Basic Energy sources (This is basically already done.)
-Tib centrifuge recipe
-blue tib
4: Future, New content
-More weaponry (If applicable)
-Advanced Energy sources
-More tech nuance (3 is a bit low to fit everything in.)
-Green tib with enough turns into blue tib
-Large enough ore spots turn into nodes?


Description of various refining paths:

Path 1: Ore Centrifuging

Insert ore and water into Centrifuge, get all products. (Iron, Copper, Stone, Uranium, Coal, Crude Oil)

Path 2: Tiberium Sludge Centrifuging- Higher Yield, more effort for refining

Process ore into sludge and waste with water in oil refinery. Waste can be reporcessed with liquid tib to be absorbed.

Feed sludge into centrifuge, get all products. (Iron, Copper, Stone, Uranium, Coal, Crude Oil)

Path 3: Liquid Tib Centrifuging- Higher Yield, more effort for refining

Process ore and water in oil refinery to make liquid tib, later tech than sludge. No waste.

Feed liquid tib into centrifuge, get all products. (Iron, Copper, Stone, Uranium, Coal, Crude Oil)

Path 4: Liquid Tib direct conversion (Through Bricks or direct from liquid)

Process ore and water in oil refinery to make liquid tib, later tech than sludge. No waste.

(OPTIONAL) Process liquid into bricks, move bricks/pipe liquid to location.

Turn into single product, lower yield than centrifuging overall.
